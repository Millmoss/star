You can access the project at https://github.com/millmoss/star

I can't figure out why, but the project won't build.

The main issue with my project has been for the past week, and still is, the lighting. At this point I'm considering creating a new project (or new scene?) and importing in all my work. The lighting also might be the culprit for the project not building so that's fun.
At the moment, the game isn't exactly in a playable state. You can walk around the surface of the island, but that's about it. The underneath of the island is still a work in progress, but I'm currently working on a way to access it.
I did start placing in a good deal of the flooring. It's pretty easy to place due to how I made the asset four pieces of one tile, so that's something.
At this point, I'm considering going with simple polygonal assets, as it's easy to create a bunch of them and make the level's artistic sense fit together better rather than pulling a bunch from online. I've gotten pretty good at whipping up assets in short time in Blender by this point, so I think this should be fine.
The main concern I have right now is definitely with writing gameplay blueprints. As a result of this, my current game plan is to get it so you can actually walk into the underground area, build that into a completed area, and then get to writing the gameplay blueprints.
